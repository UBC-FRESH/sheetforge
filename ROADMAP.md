## Phase 20: Automated Validation And Evaluation Reports

GitHub parent issue: #112

Completed branch: `feature/p20-automated-validation-reports`

Merged PR: #117

Goal: after residual blockers have concrete resolution or scope decisions, make generated-model execution, oracle execution where available, cached-value comparisons, and benchmark evaluation reports repeatable through APIs and CLI commands.

- [x] P20.4 Run repeatable evaluation and closeout. Child issue: #116.

Status: complete.

Closeout evidence:

- Synthetic generated-model evaluation passed end to end through the CLI with generated outputs
  `Summary!B2 = 70.2` and `Summary!B3 = "ok"` and no cached-validation mismatches.
- The 2020 FABLE benchmark rerun completed extraction, dependency graphing, and formula translation:
  54 sheets, 395,482 extracted cells, 296,976 formula cells, 296,976 translated formulas,
  3,543,800 dependency edges, no graph diagnostics, and no translation diagnostics.
- Full 2020 workbook equivalence is not proven yet because Modelwright does not yet infer and
  materialize a full generated-model contract with topologically ordered symbols and selected
  validation outputs for that workbook.

Ignored local evidence:

- `tmp/p20-synthetic-evaluation/summary.json`
- `tmp/p20-fable-2020-evaluation/closeout-summary.json`
- `tmp/logs/p20-synthetic-evaluation.log`
- `tmp/logs/p20-fable-2020-evaluation.log`

## Phase 21: Full Benchmark Model Materialization And Validation

GitHub parent issue: #118

Completed branch: `feature/p21-full-benchmark-model-validation`

Merged PR: #123

Goal: turn the clean 2020 FABLE extraction, graph, and translation evidence into an executable generated
Python benchmark model, then validate selected benchmark outputs and keep iterating on concrete blockers
until generated-model equivalence is either proven or sharply scoped.

- [x] P21.1 Infer generated-model contracts from dependency graphs and selected outputs. Child issue: #122.
- [x] P21.2 Materialize the 2020 FABLE generated model with topologically ordered symbols. Child issue: #121.
- [x] P21.3 Validate selected 2020 FABLE outputs against cached or oracle values. Child issue: #120.
- [x] P21.4 Rerun the blocker-find-resolve-continue loop until the benchmark result converges. Child issue: #119.

Status: complete.

Closeout evidence:

- The selected 2020 FABLE benchmark scope uses ten cached outputs from `SCENARIOS definition`.
- Extraction covered 54 sheets, 395,482 cells, and 296,976 formula cells.
- Dependency graphing produced 3,543,800 edges with no graph diagnostics.
- Formula translation covered 296,976 of 296,976 formulas with no translation diagnostics.
- Contract inference produced 20 symbols, 10 input constants, and 10 selected outputs with no diagnostics.
- Generated Python materialization produced a 207-line standalone model with no generation diagnostics.
- Generated execution returned all ten selected outputs.
- Cached workbook validation passed with ten comparisons, zero mismatches, and zero diagnostics.

Equivalence boundary:

- Proven: selected-output equivalence for the ten declared `SCENARIOS definition` outputs against cached
  workbook values.
- Not proven: full-workbook generated-model materialization, full-workbook generated-output equivalence,
  oracle-backed recalculation equivalence, and external workbook dependency behavior.

Ignored local evidence:

- `tmp/p21-fable-2020-materialization/summary.json`
- `tmp/p21-fable-2020-validation/summary.json`
- `tmp/p21-convergence-closeout/summary.json`

  - [x] Build sdist and wheel from a clean isolated build environment.
  - [x] Run artifact inspection and clean install smoke tests.
  - [x] Document TestPyPI rehearsal blocker: release workflow and trusted-publishing environments must be available after merge.
  - [x] Verify the published GitHub Pages site is the Sphinx Read the Docs themed documentation artifact.
  - [x] Record real PyPI alpha publication as deferred until TestPyPI rehearsal and maintainer approval pass.

Publication gates:

- CLI smoke verified `modelwright --help`.

Status: complete.

## Phase 27: Generated Runtime Performance And Memory Hardening

GitHub parent issue: #152

Active branch: `feature/p27-performance-memory-hardening`

Status: complete.

Goal: make full-workbook generated-model validation practical by profiling and reducing generated
runtime, cache-load, and memory costs exposed by the 2020 FABLE benchmark. This phase should start
after Phase 26 records a clear correctness pass/blocker statement, because performance work must not
hide validation defects.

Planning note: `planning/phase-27-performance-memory-hardening.md`.

- [x] P27.1 Profile generated-model runtime hotspots. Child issue: #155.
  - [x] Add high-frequency timing around generated helper functions, formula execution, range/table materialization, and criteria functions.
  - [x] Determine whether runtime is dominated by repeated formula evaluation, repeated range scans, Python import/code-object overhead, output materialization, or cache loading.
  - [x] Record profiler output and sanitized conclusions under `planning/`.
- [x] P27.2 Reduce repeated range and criteria work. Child issue: #159.
  - [x] Cache reusable range/table views where Excel semantics allow.
  - [x] Avoid rebuilding large Python lists for every `SUMIF`, `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIF`, and `COUNTIFS` call.
  - [x] Preserve lazy `IF`/`IFERROR`/`IFNA` branch behavior and runtime circular-dependency detection.
- [x] P27.3 Reduce generated module size and import overhead. Child issue: #158.
  - [x] Disable inline formula provenance comments for large generated modules and verify full FABLE correctness is unchanged.
  - [x] Compact generated output maps while preserving `calculate(inputs=None) -> dict`.
  - [x] Use expression-source formula storage for large generated modules to reduce lambda/code-object import pressure.
  - [x] Keep `calculate(inputs=None) -> dict` behavior stable unless a later public API phase intentionally changes it.
  - [x] Measure import time and generated-code object memory before and after each change.
- [x] P27.4 Reduce pipeline cache and validation memory footprint. Child issue: #157.
  - [x] Measure workbook, graph, expression, inference, generated-module, and output-map memory costs separately.
  - [x] Evaluate streaming, SQLite/shelve-style local caches, compact record encoding, or selective loading for validation.
  - [x] Explain why runtime memory can be much larger than the original workbook file size.
  - [x] Decide whether the slim oracle validation artifact should become tracked package/CLI behavior in P27 or feed the compact runtime IR backend.
- [x] P27.5 Evaluate multicore and sharded execution options. Child issue: #156.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Evaluate parallel formula rendering and validation comparison where records are independent; do not productionize because measured serial costs are already small.
  - [x] Evaluate sharded generated-output execution across separate worker processes; do not productionize naive output sharding because broad dependency closures duplicate work and memory.
  - [x] Reprofile contract inference before parallelizing it, and fix measured serial bottlenecks first.
  - [x] Add production inference fixes for ordered membership tracking and cached range-dependency expansion.
  - [x] Decide whether further parallel contract inference remains warranted after the serial fixes.
  - [x] Document CPU, memory, process startup, serialization, and determinism tradeoffs for high-core-count hosts.
- [x] P27.6 Rerun FABLE validation with performance evidence. Child issue: #160.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Always run verbose with stdout piped to `tmp/logs/` and print the tail command first.
  - [x] Record runtime, peak memory, cache-hit behavior, and correctness comparison results.
  - [x] Confirm performance changes do not regress Phase 26 correctness evidence.

Acceptance criteria:

- Performance claims are backed by logged timings and memory observations, not guesses.
- The phase states whether formulas are being recomputed unnecessarily or whether the cost is dominated
  by range scans, generated-module import, cache materialization, output materialization, or another
  measured source.
- Any optimization keeps full FABLE validation correctness evidence at least as good as before.

## Phase 28: Publish Modelwright 0.1.0a3

GitHub parent issue: #162

Active branch: `feature/p28-v0.1.0a3-release`

Status: complete.

Goal: publish `modelwright==0.1.0a3` as the alpha release that records Phase 27 performance and
memory hardening after full 2020 FABLE comparable-output validation remained green.

  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Bump package and import version to `0.1.0a3`.
  - [x] Update release deployment docs and current alpha target text.
  - [x] Record P27 performance/correctness release boundary in roadmap/changelog.
  - [x] Avoid overstating public API stability or universal workbook conversion claims.
- [x] P28.2 Verify local release artifacts for `0.1.0a3`. Child issue: #164.
  - [x] Run Ruff, pytest, Sphinx docs, docs theme verification, and `git diff --check`.
  - [x] Run `scripts/check_release_artifacts.sh`.
  - [x] Confirm artifacts contain no private workbooks, generated clones, logs, or ignored `tmp/` material.
  - [x] Record local verification evidence in roadmap/changelog and issue comments.
- [x] P28.3 Publish and verify `0.1.0a3`. Child issue: #163.
  - [x] Open and merge the release PR to `main`.
  - [x] Create annotated tag `v0.1.0a3` after merge.
  - [x] Publish through the gated GitHub Actions release workflow after maintainer approval.
  - [x] Verify PyPI JSON lists `0.1.0a3`.
  - [x] Install from PyPI into a clean ignored environment, import `modelwright`, verify `__version__`, and run `modelwright --help`.
  - [x] Verify GitHub release and docs deployment.

Release result:

- Annotated tag: `v0.1.0a3`.
- GitHub release: `modelwright 0.1.0a3`.
- PyPI package: `modelwright==0.1.0a3`.
- Clean PyPI install verified in ignored `tmp/pypi-install/modelwright-0.1.0a3/.venv`.

## Current Next Steps

## Phase 29: Model Wrapper Templates And Analyst-Facing Facades

GitHub parent issue: #167

Completed branch: `feature/p29-model-wrapper-templates`

Status: complete.

Goal: explore and implement an initial `modelwright` module that helps users build custom wrapper
facades around generated Python models, bridging the gap between raw generated cell-address APIs and
usable analyst-facing workbook structures.

Planning note: `planning/model-wrapper-template-facades.md`.

Motivation: generated Python code from a spreadsheet workbook can be validated and version controlled,
but a raw `Sheet!A1` output dictionary is not a humane analyst interface. This phase should restore
enough workbook, sheet, table, row, column, cell, scenario, and report structure around generated
models to support inspection, mutation, execution, and reporting without reintroducing spreadsheet
files as the execution environment.

  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Define the problem boundary between raw generated models and analyst-usable facades.
  - [x] Specify workbook, sheet, table, row, column, cell, and scenario concepts.
  - [x] Decide what metadata must come from extraction/generation versus user-authored wrapper declarations.
  - [x] Define inspection, mutation, execution, and reporting API sketches.
  - [x] Record non-goals: no full spreadsheet UI, no Excel dependency, no stable public API guarantee yet.
- [x] P29.2 Implement initial wrapper template module. Child issue: #170.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Add an initial `modelwright` wrapper/template module.

- [x] P29.3 Document custom wrapper workflow. Child issue: #169.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Add Sphinx docs explaining why raw generated models need facades.
  - [x] Show a minimal custom wrapper around a generated synthetic model.
  - [x] Document inspection, mutation, execution, and reporting examples.
  - [x] Document limitations and alpha API stability boundary.
  - [x] Keep examples free of private workbook content.
- [x] P29.4 Validate wrapper workflow against benchmarks. Child issue: #168.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Verify wrapper primitives against tracked synthetic fixture outputs.
  - [x] Use FABLE-derived public/extracted metadata where practical without committing private/generated artifacts.
  - [x] Add an opt-in benchmark-gated wrapper test against the local generated 2020 FABLE model.
  - [x] Confirm wrapper behavior does not change generated-model calculation semantics.
  - [x] Run full local verification.
  - [x] Record evidence in roadmap/changelog and issue comments.
- [x] P29.5 Publish `modelwright==0.1.0a4`. Child issue: #172.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Bump package/import version and release docs to `0.1.0a4`.
  - [x] Run local release artifact checks.
  - [x] Open and merge release PR to `main`.
  - [x] Create annotated tag `v0.1.0a4`.
  - [x] Publish through the gated release workflow after maintainer approval.
  - [x] Verify PyPI JSON, clean PyPI install, import version, CLI help, GitHub release, and docs deployment.

Release boundary:

- May claim an initial wrapper-template API for custom generated-model facades if tests/docs support it.
- Must not claim a full spreadsheet UI, automatic workbook semantic recovery, stable public API
  compatibility, or compact runtime IR production readiness.

Release evidence:

- PR #173 merged to `main`.
- Annotated tag: `v0.1.0a4`.
- GitHub release: `modelwright 0.1.0a4`.
- PyPI package: `modelwright==0.1.0a4`.
- Clean PyPI install verified in ignored `tmp/pypi-install/modelwright-0.1.0a4-rerun/.venv`.
- Import verified `modelwright.__version__ == "0.1.0a4"`.
- CLI help verified from the clean PyPI install.
- GitHub Pages release docs verified with Read the Docs themed markup and `0.1.0a4` content.

## Current Next Steps

## Phase 30: Notebook Interface And DataFrame Display Layer

GitHub parent issue: #174

Active branch: `feature/p30-notebook-dataframe-interface`

Status: complete.

Goal: add an optional notebook-facing layer on top of `modelwright.wrappers` that exposes wrapped
generated models as Jupyter-friendly, pandas-backed analyst workflows. This phase should support a
live-kernel loop where analysts can inspect declared inputs, outputs, and tables; mutate scenarios;
recalculate; render declared tables as DataFrames; and compare baseline-vs-scenario results without
using raw generated source or `Sheet!A1` dictionaries as the common path.

  - [x] Decide the optional dependency policy for `pandas`.
  - [x] Define helper API sketches for inputs, outputs, tables, reports, scenarios, and comparisons.
  - [x] Define non-goals: no full spreadsheet UI, no dashboard server, no automatic workbook semantic
        naming, no widget framework unless explicitly scoped, and no stable public API guarantee yet.
- [x] P30.2 Implement DataFrame view helpers. Child issue: #178.

        cell refs, and provenance where practical.
  - [x] Convert report bundles to DataFrame payloads without changing `ModelFacade` calculation behavior.
  - [x] Add focused synthetic tests.
- [x] P30.3 Implement scenario comparison helpers. Child issue: #176.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Define scenario comparison inputs and output columns.
  - [x] Include declared name, label, cell ref, baseline value, scenario value, absolute change,
        percent change where numeric, unit, role, and provenance/drilldown metadata where practical.
  - [x] Preserve generated-model execution errors as wrapper/notebook-layer errors.
  - [x] Add synthetic tests for numeric, text, missing, and zero-baseline comparison behavior.
  - [x] Keep raw cell refs available without making them the primary notebook-facing interaction.
- [x] P30.4 Add notebook-oriented docs. Child issue: #177.
  - Status: complete.

        if local artifacts support it.
  - [x] Keep generated FABLE models and raw reports under ignored `tmp/`.
  - [x] Run full local verification and record evidence in roadmap, changelog, and issue comments.
- [x] P30.6 Add examples gallery. Child issue: #181.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Add an `examples/` directory with a tiny synthetic notebook-interface example.
  - [x] Add a production-size 2020 FABLE generated-model example without tracking the original workbook.
  - [x] Keep the original FABLE workbook and raw local validation reports out of tracked files.
  - [x] Avoid ordinary Git blobs larger than GitHub/PyPI practical limits.
  - [x] Add Sphinx Examples Gallery pages linked from the docs index.
  - [x] Add lightweight tests for example integrity without running expensive production-size FABLE
        calculation in default pytest.
- [x] P30.7 Publish `modelwright==0.1.0a5`. Child issue: #180.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Confirm P30 notebook/DataFrame scope and evidence are complete.
  - [x] Bump package/import version and release docs to `0.1.0a5`.

Acceptance boundary:

- May claim initial Jupyter/DataFrame-facing helpers for wrapped generated models.
- May claim optional pandas-backed display helpers.
- May claim scenario mutation and comparison as notebook-native workflows.
- May claim synthetic and opt-in FABLE evidence that notebook helpers do not change calculation behavior.
- Must not claim a full spreadsheet UI, dashboard application, widget framework, automatic workbook
  semantic recovery, stable public API compatibility, or compact runtime IR production readiness.

Implementation evidence:

- Added `modelwright.notebooks` with lazy pandas-backed helpers:
  `inputs_frame`, `outputs_frame`, `scenario_frame`, `table_frame`, `report_frames`, and
  `compare_scenarios_frame`.
- Added the `notebook` optional extra with `pandas>=2`, while keeping pandas out of core dependencies.
- Added always-on synthetic notebook tests, including real generated synthetic model coverage and
  missing-pandas dependency behavior.
- Extended the opt-in FABLE wrapper benchmark to validate notebook DataFrame helpers over the ignored
  generated 2020 FABLE model.
- Added `examples/` with a tracked synthetic notebook-interface example and a production-size FABLE
  notebook-interface example. The FABLE generated Python output is tracked as a compressed
  `generated_fable_2020_model.py.xz` artifact because the uncompressed module is larger than ordinary
  GitHub per-file limits.

Verification evidence:

- `scripts/bootstrap_dev_env.sh` passed and installed the updated `dev` extra.
- `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .` passed.
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -vv` passed with `161` passed and `1` skipped benchmark.
- `.venv/bin/sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W` passed.
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/verify_docs_theme.py _build/html` passed.
- `MODELWRIGHT_RUN_FABLE_BENCHMARKS=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest -vv tests/test_fable_wrapper_benchmark.py`
  passed in `149.67` seconds, using ignored local FABLE artifacts under `tmp/p26-fable-full-validation/`.
- `scripts/check_release_artifacts.sh` passed for `0.1.0a5`; the clean wheel install imported
  `modelwright 0.1.0a5` and the artifact inspection found no forbidden private workbook, ignored
  `tmp/`, or source workbook content.
- Release artifacts from the local check were about `56K` for the wheel and `2.2M` for the sdist. The
  sdist includes the compressed FABLE generated-model example; the wheel remains package-code only.

Release result:

- PR #182 merged to `main`.
- Annotated tag: `v0.1.0a5`.
- GitHub release: `modelwright 0.1.0a5`.
- PyPI package: `modelwright==0.1.0a5`.
- Clean PyPI install verified in ignored `tmp/pypi-install/modelwright-0.1.0a5/.venv` with
  `modelwright[notebook]==0.1.0a5`.
- Import verified `modelwright.__version__ == "0.1.0a5"`.
- Notebook extra verified by importing pandas and `modelwright.notebooks.inputs_frame`.
- CLI help verified from the clean PyPI install.
- GitHub Pages release docs verified with Read the Docs themed Examples Gallery, notebook-interface
  guide, and `0.1.0a5` release-deployment content.

## Current Next Steps

GitHub parent issue: #183

Active branch: `feature/p31-literate-notebook-examples`

Status: complete.

Goal: substantially enhance the examples seed from Phase 30 with actual known-valid Jupyter
notebook files and matching Sphinx gallery documentation. The notebooks should follow a literate

        default tests.
  - [x] Run Ruff, pytest, Sphinx docs, and docs theme verification.

## Current Next Steps

Phase 34 is complete on `main`: Modelwright's FreshForge provider can execute
supported generated-model workflow stages using Modelwright Python APIs and the
FreshForge serial local runner.

Phase 32 is complete: `modelwright==0.1.0a7` is published to PyPI and GitHub as the generated-model
workflow orchestration alpha.

Phase 35 is complete on `main`: Modelwright's FreshForge provider now emits compact stage
summaries and sharper diagnostics for generated-model workflows, using FreshForge Phase 7
namespaces and whole-run summaries where useful.

Phase 36 is complete on `main`: Modelwright now packages generic compact validation-evidence
summaries for downstream automation without copying raw generated source, generated values,
workbooks, or full validation reports.

## Phase 33: FreshForge Provider Pilot For Modelwright Workflows

GitHub parent issue: #205

Active branch: `feature/p33-modelwright-freshforge-provider`.

Status: complete.

Goal: add a plan-only FreshForge provider for Modelwright workflow stages so FreshForge can discover,
validate, inspect, and plan workbook-to-generated-model workflows without executing Modelwright

  - [x] Define provider id `modelwright`.
  - [x] Expose plan-only node types for workbook extraction, graphing, contract inference,
        generation, execution, validation evaluation, and conversion planning.
  - [x] Validate required inputs, outputs, parameters, and artifacts declared by provider metadata.
  - [x] Confirm provider metadata serializes deterministically.
- [x] P33.3 Add public-safe generated-model workflow example. Child issue: #208.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Add `examples/freshforge/generated_model_workflow.yaml`.

  - [x] Document why FABLE-specific output-ref discovery belongs in FABLE Pyculator.
  - [x] Add tests for provider discovery, example planning, metadata, and diagnostics.
- [ ] P33.5 Verify, PR, and close Phase 33. Child issue: #210.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Run Ruff, pytest, Sphinx docs, docs theme verification, release artifact checks, and
        `git diff --check`.

  inspection, and planning.
- Must not claim FreshForge executes Modelwright nodes, materializes artifacts, caches stages,
  checkpoints runs, or replaces Modelwright CLI/API execution.
- Must keep FABLE-specific output-ref discovery out of Modelwright.
- Must keep normal `import modelwright` from importing FreshForge eagerly.

Implementation evidence:

  `modelwright`.
- Added a PyPI-safe `freshforge.providers` entry point without adding a FreshForge package dependency.
- Added plan-only node types for extraction, graphing, contract inference, generation, execution,
  validation evaluation, and conversion planning.

## Phase 34: Executable FreshForge Provider For Generated-Model Workflows

GitHub parent issue: #213

Active branch: `feature/p34-freshforge-executable-provider`.

Status: complete.

Goal: make Modelwright's FreshForge provider executable for the generated-model workflow while
keeping normal `import modelwright` FreshForge-free and preserving PyPI-safe package metadata.

- [x] P34.1 Update provider execution contract and workflow artifact requirements. Child issue:
      #214.
  - [x] Make `model_infer_contract` executable from an explicit workbook path and output refs.
  - [x] Require concrete artifact paths on executable generation, execution, and evaluation nodes.
  - [x] Keep FABLE-specific output-ref discovery outside Modelwright.
- [x] P34.2 Implement executable generated-model nodes with Python APIs. Child issue: #215.
  - [x] Add `run_node(...)` support to `modelwright.freshforge`.
  - [x] Use Modelwright Python payload helpers instead of CLI subprocesses.
  - [x] Write inference, generation, execution, and evaluation JSON artifacts.
- [x] P34.3 Add synthetic workflow run tests and CLI compatibility checks. Child issue: #216.
  - [x] Add a FreshForge run test over the synthetic workbook fixture.
  - [x] Confirm the generated model executes and cached validation passes.
  - [x] Preserve the normal import boundary that avoids eager FreshForge imports.
- [x] P34.4 Update docs, roadmap, changelog, and examples. Child issue: #217.
  - [x] Update the public FreshForge example workflow artifact declarations.
  - [x] Update FreshForge provider docs and workflow-boundary docs.
  - [x] Record Phase 34 evidence in the roadmap and changelog.
- [x] P34.5 Verify, PR, deploy docs, and close phase. Child issue: #218.
  - [x] Run full local verification.
  - [x] Open PR and verify CI/docs.
  - [x] Confirm post-merge docs deployment.

Acceptance boundary:

- May claim Modelwright's FreshForge provider can execute supported generated-model workflow stages
  through Python APIs.
- Must not claim FreshForge chooses workbook output refs, executes shell commands, caches stages, or
  validates arbitrary workbook equivalence.
- Must keep normal `import modelwright` from importing FreshForge eagerly.

Implementation evidence:

- Updated `modelwright.freshforge` with `run_node(...)` support.
- Updated `examples/freshforge/generated_model_workflow.yaml` with executable artifact paths.
- Added synthetic FreshForge run coverage for infer, generate, execute, and validation-evaluate.
- Updated Sphinx docs for FreshForge planning versus run behavior.

Verification evidence:

Goal: improve machine-readable summaries and diagnostics for Modelwright generated-model workflows
used through FreshForge and downstream tools.

- [x] P35.1 Define generated-model stage summary contract. Child issue: #224.
  - [x] Add compact stage summaries under `ProviderRunResult.data["summary"]`.
  - [x] Summarize inference, generation, execution, and validation-evaluation stages.
- [x] P35.2 Add provider diagnostics and failure semantics. Child issue: #223.
  - [x] Reject empty required artifact path strings and empty required outputs.
  - [x] Emit stage-specific diagnostics for generation, execution, and validation failures.
  - [x] Treat explicit validation failure as FreshForge node failure.
- [x] P35.3 Add FreshForge namespace and summary integration tests. Child issue: #225.
  - [x] Run the synthetic generated-model workflow with a FreshForge run namespace.

  - [x] Open PR and verify CI/docs.
  - [x] Confirm post-merge docs deployment.

Dependency note: this phase should consume FreshForge Phase 7 run namespaces/summaries where useful
and provide the stage-level generated-model summaries needed by FABLE Pyculator Phase 18 output-ref
strategy comparisons.

Acceptance boundary:

- May expose clearer generated-model workflow status, artifact, and diagnostic summaries.
- Must not add FABLE output-table discovery, scenario-bundle semantics, or FreshForge orchestration
  policy beyond provider-owned generated-model execution details.

Implementation evidence:

- Added compact provider stage summaries for `model_infer_contract`, `model_generate`,
  `model_execute`, and `validation_evaluate` under `ProviderRunResult.data["summary"]`.
- Added validation diagnostics for empty required output and artifact declarations.
- Added stage-specific failure diagnostics for generated-model generation, execution, and validation
  failures while preserving generic unexpected-exception diagnostics.
- Added fail-fast validation semantics when cached/oracle validation reports explicitly fail.
- Added namespaced FreshForge synthetic workflow tests that assert FreshForge run summaries and
  Modelwright stage summaries together.

Local verification:

- `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .` passed.
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` passed with 184 tests and 1 skipped benchmark.
- `.venv/bin/sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W` passed.

- PR Test workflow run 28547298026 passed quality, pytest, and release-artifact jobs.
- PR docs-pages workflow run 28547298025 passed.
- Post-merge Test workflow run 28547368269 passed quality, pytest, and release-artifact jobs.
- Post-merge docs-pages workflow run 28547368962 passed and deployed GitHub Pages.

## Phase 36: Compact Validation Evidence Extraction For Downstream Automation

GitHub parent issue: #221

Active branch: `main` after PR #234.

Status: complete.

Goal: expose compact generated-model validation evidence that downstream packages can record in
docs, planning notes, and optional CI workflows without tracking raw validation reports.

- [x] P36.1 Define generic validation-evidence schema and paths. Child issue: #231.
  - [x] Add generic evidence identity and default path conventions.
  - [x] Add `ValidationEvidencePaths` and `ValidationEvidenceSummary`.
  - [x] Keep FABLE-specific workbook-version wording out of Modelwright.
- [x] P36.2 Add evidence extraction and conservative equivalence status logic. Child issue: #232.
  - [x] Summarize inference, generation, generated values, validation scenario, and evaluation
        artifacts.
  - [x] Mark missing artifacts as skipped unless required.
  - [x] Mark evidence incomplete when explicit comparison counts are absent.
  - [x] Mark equivalence pass only with explicit comparable/match/mismatch zero-mismatch evidence.
- [x] P36.3 Add writer and CLI packaging command. Child issue: #229.
  - [x] Write compact `summary.json` and `summary.md` files.
  - [x] Add `modelwright validation evidence`.
  - [x] Support evidence id, artifact/output dirs, scenario path, require-artifacts, and JSON output
        flags.
- [x] P36.4 Update docs, roadmap, changelog, and downstream guidance. Child issue: #230.
  - [x] Add API and CLI documentation.
  - [x] Add validation-evidence guide and cross-link generated-model workflow docs.
  - [x] Update the Phase 35/36 downstream planning note.
- [x] P36.5 Verify, PR, deploy docs, and close phase. Child issue: #233.
  - [x] Run full local verification.
  - [x] Open PR from `feature/p36-compact-validation-evidence` to `main`.
  - [x] Merge only after CI passes.
  - [x] Confirm post-merge Test and Docs Pages workflows pass.
  - [x] Close Phase 36 child issues and parent #221.

Dependency note: this phase follows Phase 35 because compact evidence should be derived from stable
stage summaries and diagnostics. FABLE Pyculator Phase 20 should consume this generic evidence rather
than duplicating raw Modelwright validation-report parsing.

Acceptance boundary:

- May summarize validation evidence for downstream publication and CI gates.
- Must not declare arbitrary workbook equivalence or absorb FABLE-specific output selection logic.

Implementation evidence:

- Added `modelwright.evidence` with generic validation-evidence path and summary records.
- Added conservative extraction rules for existing inference, generation, generated-values,
  validation-scenario, and evaluation artifacts.
- Added sanitized `summary.json` and `summary.md` writers that report counts and statuses without
  copying raw generated source, raw generated output values, workbook contents, or full comparison
  rows.
- Added `modelwright validation evidence` with evidence id, artifact/output directory, scenario,
  require-artifacts, and JSON output options.
- Added Sphinx guide, CLI reference, API reference, and generated-model workflow cross-links.

Local verification:

- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_evidence.py tests/test_cli.py tests/test_public_api.py -q`
  passed with 28 tests.
- `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .` passed.

- `scripts/check_release_artifacts.sh` passed; artifact inspection included `modelwright/evidence.py`,
  and the clean wheel install imported `modelwright 0.1.0a7` and smoke-tested the CLI.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Phase 36 PR #234 merged to `main` with merge commit `06814c5`.
- PR Test workflow passed quality, pytest, and release-artifact jobs after the CI help-rendering test
  fix.
- PR docs-pages workflow passed.
- Post-merge Test workflow run 28548149402 passed quality, pytest, and release-artifact jobs.
- Post-merge docs-pages workflow run 28548149355 passed and deployed GitHub Pages.

Acceptance boundary:

- May claim a documented onboarding and validation pilot workflow for FABLE Pyculator testers.
- May claim structured validation and usability feedback can be captured through GitHub issues and
  manifest seeds.
- Must not claim arbitrary FABLE country calculator support, production FABLE-P Canada readiness,
  stable public API compatibility, or a full scenario automation framework.

Implementation evidence:

- Added `docs/guides/fable-pyculator-onboarding.rst` and linked it from the Sphinx guide index.
- Added GitHub issue forms for FABLE validation runs, setup problems, and usability observations.
- Added `planning/phase-32-fable-pyculator-onboarding-validation-pilot.md` with local artifact rules,
  validation protocol, usability protocol, and manifest-seed intent.
- Added `examples/fable_2020/scenario_output_manifest.example.json` as a sanitized seed for recording
  scenario inputs and selected Excel-vs-Python output comparisons.
- Updated `MANIFEST.in` so JSON example artifacts are included in source distributions.
- Added `modelwright model infer-contract` to materialize `contract.json`, `expressions.json`, and
  `constants.json` from a source workbook plus explicit selected output refs, and documented the
  generated-model artifact workflow for FABLE Pyculator testers.

  the FABLE Pyculator 2021 validation run.
- Added plan-only and executable FreshForge provider integration after the first-user feedback loop,
  allowing FreshForge to validate, plan, and execute supported Modelwright generated-model workflow
  stages when FreshForge is installed separately.
