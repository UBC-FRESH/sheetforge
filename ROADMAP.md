## Phase 20: Automated Validation And Evaluation Reports

GitHub parent issue: #112

Completed branch: `feature/p20-automated-validation-reports`

Merged PR: #117

Goal: after residual blockers have concrete resolution or scope decisions, make generated-model execution, oracle execution where available, cached-value comparisons, and benchmark evaluation reports repeatable through APIs and CLI commands.

- [x] P20.4 Run repeatable evaluation and closeout. Child issue: #116.

Status: complete.

Closeout evidence:

- Synthetic generated-model evaluation passed end to end through the CLI with generated outputs
  `Summary!B2 = 70.2` and `Summary!B3 = "ok"` and no cached-validation mismatches.
- The 2020 FABLE benchmark rerun completed extraction, dependency graphing, and formula translation:
  54 sheets, 395,482 extracted cells, 296,976 formula cells, 296,976 translated formulas,
  3,543,800 dependency edges, no graph diagnostics, and no translation diagnostics.
- Full 2020 workbook equivalence is not proven yet because Modelwright does not yet infer and
  materialize a full generated-model contract with topologically ordered symbols and selected
  validation outputs for that workbook.

Ignored local evidence:

- `tmp/p20-synthetic-evaluation/summary.json`
- `tmp/p20-fable-2020-evaluation/closeout-summary.json`
- `tmp/logs/p20-synthetic-evaluation.log`
- `tmp/logs/p20-fable-2020-evaluation.log`

## Phase 21: Full Benchmark Model Materialization And Validation

GitHub parent issue: #118

Completed branch: `feature/p21-full-benchmark-model-validation`

Merged PR: #123

Goal: turn the clean 2020 FABLE extraction, graph, and translation evidence into an executable generated
Python benchmark model, then validate selected benchmark outputs and keep iterating on concrete blockers
until generated-model equivalence is either proven or sharply scoped.

- [x] P21.1 Infer generated-model contracts from dependency graphs and selected outputs. Child issue: #122.
- [x] P21.2 Materialize the 2020 FABLE generated model with topologically ordered symbols. Child issue: #121.
- [x] P21.3 Validate selected 2020 FABLE outputs against cached or oracle values. Child issue: #120.
- [x] P21.4 Rerun the blocker-find-resolve-continue loop until the benchmark result converges. Child issue: #119.

Status: complete.

Closeout evidence:

- The selected 2020 FABLE benchmark scope uses ten cached outputs from `SCENARIOS definition`.
- Extraction covered 54 sheets, 395,482 cells, and 296,976 formula cells.
- Dependency graphing produced 3,543,800 edges with no graph diagnostics.
- Formula translation covered 296,976 of 296,976 formulas with no translation diagnostics.
- Contract inference produced 20 symbols, 10 input constants, and 10 selected outputs with no diagnostics.
- Generated Python materialization produced a 207-line standalone model with no generation diagnostics.
- Generated execution returned all ten selected outputs.
- Cached workbook validation passed with ten comparisons, zero mismatches, and zero diagnostics.

Equivalence boundary:

- Proven: selected-output equivalence for the ten declared `SCENARIOS definition` outputs against cached
  workbook values.
- Not proven: full-workbook generated-model materialization, full-workbook generated-output equivalence,
  oracle-backed recalculation equivalence, and external workbook dependency behavior.

Ignored local evidence:

- `tmp/p21-fable-2020-materialization/summary.json`
- `tmp/p21-fable-2020-validation/summary.json`
- `tmp/p21-convergence-closeout/summary.json`

  - [x] Build sdist and wheel from a clean isolated build environment.
  - [x] Run artifact inspection and clean install smoke tests.
  - [x] Document TestPyPI rehearsal blocker: release workflow and trusted-publishing environments must be available after merge.
  - [x] Verify the published GitHub Pages site is the Sphinx Read the Docs themed documentation artifact.
  - [x] Record real PyPI alpha publication as deferred until TestPyPI rehearsal and maintainer approval pass.

Publication gates:

## Phase 27: Generated Runtime Performance And Memory Hardening

GitHub parent issue: #152

Active branch: `feature/p27-performance-memory-hardening`

Status: complete.

Goal: make full-workbook generated-model validation practical by profiling and reducing generated
runtime, cache-load, and memory costs exposed by the 2020 FABLE benchmark. This phase should start
after Phase 26 records a clear correctness pass/blocker statement, because performance work must not
hide validation defects.

Planning note: `planning/phase-27-performance-memory-hardening.md`.

- [x] P27.1 Profile generated-model runtime hotspots. Child issue: #155.
  - [x] Add high-frequency timing around generated helper functions, formula execution, range/table materialization, and criteria functions.
  - [x] Determine whether runtime is dominated by repeated formula evaluation, repeated range scans, Python import/code-object overhead, output materialization, or cache loading.
  - [x] Record profiler output and sanitized conclusions under `planning/`.
- [x] P27.2 Reduce repeated range and criteria work. Child issue: #159.
  - [x] Cache reusable range/table views where Excel semantics allow.
  - [x] Avoid rebuilding large Python lists for every `SUMIF`, `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIF`, and `COUNTIFS` call.
  - [x] Preserve lazy `IF`/`IFERROR`/`IFNA` branch behavior and runtime circular-dependency detection.
- [x] P27.3 Reduce generated module size and import overhead. Child issue: #158.
  - [x] Disable inline formula provenance comments for large generated modules and verify full FABLE correctness is unchanged.
  - [x] Compact generated output maps while preserving `calculate(inputs=None) -> dict`.
  - [x] Use expression-source formula storage for large generated modules to reduce lambda/code-object import pressure.
  - [x] Keep `calculate(inputs=None) -> dict` behavior stable unless a later public API phase intentionally changes it.
  - [x] Measure import time and generated-code object memory before and after each change.
- [x] P27.4 Reduce pipeline cache and validation memory footprint. Child issue: #157.
  - [x] Measure workbook, graph, expression, inference, generated-module, and output-map memory costs separately.
  - [x] Evaluate streaming, SQLite/shelve-style local caches, compact record encoding, or selective loading for validation.
  - [x] Explain why runtime memory can be much larger than the original workbook file size.
  - [x] Decide whether the slim oracle validation artifact should become tracked package/CLI behavior in P27 or feed the compact runtime IR backend.
- [x] P27.5 Evaluate multicore and sharded execution options. Child issue: #156.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Evaluate parallel formula rendering and validation comparison where records are independent; do not productionize because measured serial costs are already small.
  - [x] Evaluate sharded generated-output execution across separate worker processes; do not productionize naive output sharding because broad dependency closures duplicate work and memory.
  - [x] Reprofile contract inference before parallelizing it, and fix measured serial bottlenecks first.
  - [x] Add production inference fixes for ordered membership tracking and cached range-dependency expansion.
  - [x] Decide whether further parallel contract inference remains warranted after the serial fixes.
  - [x] Document CPU, memory, process startup, serialization, and determinism tradeoffs for high-core-count hosts.
- [x] P27.6 Rerun FABLE validation with performance evidence. Child issue: #160.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Always run verbose with stdout piped to `tmp/logs/` and print the tail command first.
  - [x] Record runtime, peak memory, cache-hit behavior, and correctness comparison results.
  - [x] Confirm performance changes do not regress Phase 26 correctness evidence.

Acceptance criteria:

- Performance claims are backed by logged timings and memory observations, not guesses.
- The phase states whether formulas are being recomputed unnecessarily or whether the cost is dominated
  by range scans, generated-module import, cache materialization, output materialization, or another
  measured source.
- Any optimization keeps full FABLE validation correctness evidence at least as good as before.

## Phase 28: Publish Modelwright 0.1.0a3

GitHub parent issue: #162

Active branch: `feature/p28-v0.1.0a3-release`

Status: active.

Goal: publish `modelwright==0.1.0a3` as the alpha release that records Phase 27 performance and
memory hardening after full 2020 FABLE comparable-output validation remained green.

- [x] P28.1 Update `0.1.0a3` release metadata and notes. Child issue: #165.
  - Status: complete.
  - [x] Bump package and import version to `0.1.0a3`.
  - [x] Update release deployment docs and current alpha target text.
  - [x] Record P27 performance/correctness release boundary in roadmap/changelog.
  - [x] Avoid overstating public API stability or universal workbook conversion claims.
- [x] P28.2 Verify local release artifacts for `0.1.0a3`. Child issue: #164.
  - [x] Run Ruff, pytest, Sphinx docs, docs theme verification, and `git diff --check`.
  - [x] Run `scripts/check_release_artifacts.sh`.
  - [x] Confirm artifacts contain no private workbooks, generated clones, logs, or ignored `tmp/` material.
  - [x] Record local verification evidence in roadmap/changelog and issue comments.
- [ ] P28.3 Publish and verify `0.1.0a3`. Child issue: #163.
  - [ ] Open and merge the release PR to `main`.
  - [ ] Create annotated tag `v0.1.0a3` after merge.
  - [ ] Publish through the gated GitHub Actions release workflow after maintainer approval.
  - [ ] Verify PyPI JSON lists `0.1.0a3`.
  - [ ] Install from PyPI into a clean ignored environment, import `modelwright`, verify `__version__`, and run `modelwright --help`.
  - [ ] Verify GitHub release and docs deployment.

Release claim boundary:

- May claim full comparable-output validation for the 2020 FABLE benchmark remains green.
- May claim measured generated-runtime performance and import/source-size improvements from P27.
- Must not claim stable public API, universal workbook conversion, Excel-backed recalculation
  equivalence, or compact runtime IR production readiness.

## Current Next Steps

1. Open the P28 release PR back to `main`.
2. Wait for CI release artifact checks and docs build to pass.
3. Merge the release PR, then create annotated tag `v0.1.0a3`.
4. Publish `0.1.0a3` only after the release PR is merged and the maintainer approves the release workflow gate.
