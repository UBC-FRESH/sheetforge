# Phase 18 Closeout And Phase 19 Inputs

Date: 2026-06-20

## Scope Closed

Phase 18 turned the prior extraction, dependency graph, formula translation, generation, and validation
pieces into an explicit conversion-planning surface.

Completed pieces:

- conversion-plan contract in `planning/conversion-plan-contract.md`;
- package records and `build_conversion_plan`;
- public external FABLE Calculator benchmark metadata, checksums, and canonical ignored local paths;
- `scripts/materialize_fable_benchmarks.py` plus `scripts/bootstrap_dev_env.sh --benchmarks`;
- `sheetforge conversion plan` CLI;
- residual-blocker classification for extraction, named ranges, formula extraction, graphing,
  translation, generation, cached validation, and oracle validation diagnostics;
- Read the Docs Sphinx theme configuration aligned with the other FRESH lab packages.

The conversion plan remains a status report, not a generated workbook clone or proof of equivalence.

## Closeout Workflow Evidence

The closeout workflow was run with stdout and stderr redirected to:

```text
tmp/logs/p18-closeout-classified-plan-verification.log
```

Local ignored plan outputs:

```text
tmp/conversion-plans/p18-synthetic-conversion-plan.json
tmp/conversion-plans/p18-fable-2020-conversion-plan.json
```

The synthetic fixture conversion plan reported:

- workflow status: extraction, dependency graph, and formula translation passed;
- formula cells: 5;
- translated formula cells: 5;
- translation coverage: 1.0;
- generation, cached validation, and oracle validation: not run;
- residual blocker: 5 missing cached formula values from the generated fixture workbook.

The 2020 FABLE primary benchmark conversion plan reported:

- workflow status: extraction, dependency graph, and formula translation passed;
- overall status: partial;
- sheets: 54;
- cells: 395,482;
- formula cells: 296,976;
- translated formula cells: 296,976;
- untranslated formula cells: 0;
- translation coverage: 1.0;
- named ranges: 128;
- dependency edges: 3,543,800;
- semantic edges: 1,771,900;
- execution edges: 1,771,900.

Sanitized 2020 diagnostic summary:

- workbook extraction: 1 unsupported external link;
- named ranges: 6 unresolved named ranges;
- formula extraction: 15,235 missing cached formula values;
- formula extraction: 1,748,603 structured-reference diagnostics kept visible at extraction level;
- formula extraction: 474 volatile-function diagnostics;
- graph: 1 circular dependency;
- formula translation: no diagnostics.

The 2020 residual-blocker classification now reports:

- `unsupported_external_link`: `external_dependency`, deferred;
- `unresolved_named_range`: `unsupported_reference_semantics`, next target;
- `missing_cached_formula_value`: `missing_cached_values`, deferred;
- `unsupported_structured_reference`: `unsupported_reference_semantics`, deferred;
- `unsupported_volatile_function`: `unsupported_formula_semantics`, deferred;
- `circular_dependency`: `graph_semantics`, next target.

The generated recommendations are:

- resolve named-range semantics or document why unresolved ranges are out of conversion scope;
- define graph semantics or reporting policy for the circular dependency.

## Verification

Targeted closeout verification passed:

- conversion-plan and CLI tests;
- focused Ruff checks;
- synthetic and 2020 conversion-plan CLI runs;
- Sphinx docs build with warnings treated as errors;
- `git diff --check`.

Full repository verification should be run before the Phase 18 PR is opened.

## Phase 19 Inputs

Phase 19 should automate validation and evaluation reports rather than adding more formula semantics by
default.

Highest-priority inputs:

- generated model execution API for selected outputs;
- cached-value validation orchestration from generated model outputs;
- oracle orchestration that reports backend blockers explicitly;
- evaluation report CLI that combines conversion plan, generation, execution, cached validation, and
  oracle validation results;
- native verbose progress output for long-running conversion-plan and evaluation commands so workbook
  runs can be monitored without waiting for final JSON output;
- persisted local logs under `tmp/logs/` for every real-workbook benchmark pass;
- repeated 2020 FABLE primary benchmark run as the first Phase 19 acceptance target.

Phase 19 should treat the 2020 benchmark as the primary convergence target, the 2019 benchmark as a
broken-reference regression case, and the 2021 benchmark as a later stress benchmark.
