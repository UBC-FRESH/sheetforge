# Phase 17 Closeout And Phase 18 Inputs

Date: 2026-06-20

## Scope Closed

Phase 17 expanded real-workbook formula semantics through an explicit blocker-find-resolve-rerun loop. The implemented slices were:

- boolean literals, unary minus, exponentiation, text concatenation, and explicit error-reference diagnostics;
- scalar functions including logical, error-handling, aggregation, and text concatenation forms;
- table-backed structured references for supported current-row, whole-column, whole-table, and data-body forms;
- criteria functions `SUMIF`, `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIF`, and `COUNTIFS`;
- lookup function `VLOOKUP`, including table-array structured references;
- constrained cross-table current-row structured references;
- constrained static `OFFSET` references.

The phase intentionally did not claim general Excel equivalence. It translated only semantics that could be represented with explicit provenance and tested generated Python behavior.

## Verification

Final local verification passed:

- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest`;
- `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .`;
- `.venv/bin/sphinx-build -b html docs _build/html -W`;
- `git diff --check`.

The final test suite had 97 passing tests.

The final private diagnostic pass was run with very-verbose output redirected to ignored local logs and reports under `tmp/private-evaluations/eval-001/`.

## Final Sanitized Private Diagnostics

Final P17 private diagnostic counts:

- formula cells: 215,728;
- translated formula cells: 215,422;
- untranslated formula cells: 306;
- unsupported-function first failures: 0;
- unsupported structured-reference first failures: 0;
- explicit unsupported error references: 306;
- generated direct-output candidates: 10;
- selected generated outputs: 10;
- selected input dependencies: 13;
- cached generated validation: 10 outputs, 0 mismatches;
- `formulas` oracle validation: blocked by oracle calculation failure.

Other sanitized diagnostics still visible in the workbook evaluation:

- unresolved named ranges: 6;
- missing cached formula values: 15,560;
- volatile-function extraction diagnostics: 308;
- graph diagnostics: 1 circular dependency.

These are not all P17 translation blockers. They are important inputs for conversion planning, residual-risk reporting, and validation strategy.

## Residual Blocker Classification

Resolved in P17:

- unsupported functions observed as first-failure translation blockers;
- unsupported operator and token forms observed in the private diagnostic loop;
- structured-reference first-failure translation blockers;
- unresolved structured-reference translation performance traps.

Blocked by design:

- 306 formulas with explicit error references. Sheetforge should not silently turn workbook `#REF!` formulas into normal generated Python behavior. A conversion plan should classify these as repair, exclusion, error-preserving generated behavior, or out-of-scope workbook damage.

Deferred to structural design phases:

- circular dependency handling;
- unresolved named-range policy beyond currently supported workbook-level destinations;
- missing cached-value policy for validation examples;
- volatile-function risk reporting beyond the constrained static `OFFSET` translation subset;
- full-workbook oracle strategy after the pure-Python `formulas` oracle failed to calculate this private workbook.

## Convergence Decision

Phase 17 converged for formula-semantics expansion: repeated implementation passes reduced unsupported-function, unsupported-operator, unsupported-token, and structured-reference first-failure translation categories to zero in the private diagnostic pass.

Phase 17 did not prove full private-workbook equivalence. The generated subset still validates only against cached workbook values for selected direct outputs, and the pure-Python oracle remains blocked. The remaining 306 untranslated formulas are explicit error-reference formulas, which should be handled by conversion planning and residual reporting rather than by pretending the workbook has valid references.

## Phase 18 Inputs

Phase 18 should shift from adding formula semantics to building a conversion plan workflow.

After Phase 17 closeout, local cross-version inspection showed that the original private workbook used for convergence contains explicit broken references in formula text, while the later private workbook versions do not. The primary private benchmark should therefore shift to the clean later workbook version rather than spending conversion-planning effort on source-workbook repair.

Private benchmark policy:

- use the 2020 workbook as the primary private convergence benchmark;
- use the 2021 workbook as a later stress benchmark once 2020 is stable;
- keep the 2019 workbook as a broken-reference regression case that proves Sheetforge reports explicit source `#REF!` formulas sharply and does not silently generate normal behavior for them.

The 2020 baseline run used explicit local workbook selection and very-verbose logging under ignored `tmp/`.

Sanitized 2020 baseline diagnostics:

- formula cells: 296,976;
- translated formula cells: 296,319;
- untranslated formula cells: 657;
- unsupported-function first failures: 657;
- identified unsupported function: `_XLFN.IFNA`;
- unsupported structured-reference first failures: 0;
- explicit unsupported error references: 0;
- generated direct-output candidates: 10;
- selected generated outputs: 10;
- selected input dependencies: 10;
- cached generated validation: 10 outputs, 0 mismatches;
- `formulas` oracle validation: blocked by oracle calculation failure;
- graph diagnostics: 1 circular dependency;
- unresolved named ranges: 6;
- missing cached formula values: 15,235;
- volatile-function extraction diagnostics: 474;
- unsupported external links: 1.

This makes `_XLFN.IFNA` the next formula-semantics ratchet target if Phase 18 conversion planning chooses to continue formula coverage. The compatibility prefix should be normalized deliberately; Sheetforge should support the semantics as `IFNA`, while preserving a diagnostic/provenance trail that the source workbook used Excel's `_xlfn` compatibility form.

The conversion plan should report:

- total formula, translated formula, and untranslated formula counts;
- translated formula coverage percentage;
- residual blocker categories and counts;
- whether each residual category is resolved, blocked by design, deferred, or out of target scope;
- generated-output subset selection and validation status;
- source-workbook diagnostics that affect conversion risk;
- oracle availability and reason when no full oracle is available.

For the 2019 broken-reference regression workbook, a conversion-plan acceptance target should say:

- formula translation coverage is 215,422 of 215,728 formulas;
- all observed unsupported function and structured-reference first-failure categories are resolved;
- 306 explicit error-reference formulas remain blocked by design;
- cached generated validation passes for the selected direct-output subset;
- full oracle validation is unavailable through the current pure-Python backend.

For the 2020 primary benchmark workbook, the first conversion-plan acceptance target should say:

- formula translation coverage is 296,319 of 296,976 formulas;
- the only current translation first-failure category is `_XLFN.IFNA`;
- no explicit error-reference formulas are present in the translation blocker set;
- cached generated validation passes for the selected direct-output subset;
- full oracle validation is unavailable through the current pure-Python backend.

Phase 18 should avoid adding more formula semantics unless the conversion plan exposes a concrete, newly prioritized blocker. The next project risk is no longer "unknown formula support"; it is making conversion status, residual blockers, generated outputs, and validation evidence repeatable and visible.
